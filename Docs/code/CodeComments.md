# Code Comments

This files contains comments on the code. There are 2 reasons for this, one being to remind myself about my decisions, the seconds to explain those decisions to others.

## Naming of traits
Since Groovy handles the use of traits the same as interfaces, that is _implements mytrait_ you can't tell if it is an interface or a trait that is specified. There is however a big difference in functionality between an interface and a trait. Therefore I've decided to name all traits "_name_Trait" to make it very clear it is a trait and not an interface.
