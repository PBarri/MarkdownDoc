                Unfortunately I had to set this to true. I tried to package just the jars and provide
                a Class-Path: entry, but then the Main class was found but the other dependencies was
                not. I suspect that each individual jar within the jar must have their own MANIFEST.MF
                with a Class-Path: for that to work. It just became to messy, so I took the simple
                approach. /Tommy
