# Paragraphs

This is a simple one line paragraph.

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines.
(A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line â€” a line containing nothing but spaces or
tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

This is a _formatting_ __Paragraph__. Here is [a link](http://to.somewhere.net/). Another [link] to somewhere. This paragraph
also contains a `simple code block`. And here is an ![image](http://groovy.codehaus.org/images/groovy-logo-medium.png).
Some more text in this paragraph. <www.somewhere.net> ends this paragraph.

\* This is not a list since the \'\*\' is escaped!
